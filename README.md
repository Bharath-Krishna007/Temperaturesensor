# Temperaturesensor
- Used arduino uno and LM35 temperature sensor to measure room temperature
- The USB connection with the PC is necessary to program the board and to power it up. Used Arduino IDE software to write the code to ineract with arduino uno
- Finally, obtained temperature display on the serial port monitor which is updated every second.
